            Originally raised for cockfighting during the 500 B.C time frame in China according to estimations in the
            study
            of the sub-haplogroup <br>C1,<sup>[2]</sup>or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until
            the
            Hellenistic
            period (4th–2nd centuries BC).<sup><a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken#cite_note-npr.org-3">[3]</a> <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken#cite_note-pmid26195775-4">[4]</a></sup> Humans now keep
            chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both
            their meat and eggs) and as pets.</p>

        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <section>
            An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster and an adult female is called a
            hen.[13][14]
            Other terms are:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Biddy: a newly hatched chicken[15][16]</li>
                <li>Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken[a]</li>
                <li>Chick: a young chicken[17]</li>
                <li>Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)[18]</li>
                <li>Cockerel: a young male chicken less than a year old[19]</li>
                <li>Dunghill fowl: a chicken with mixed parentage from different domestic varieties.[20]</li>
                <li>Pullet: a young female chicken less than a year old.[21] In the poultry industry, a pullet is a
                    sexually immature chicken less than 22 weeks of age.[22]</li>
                <li>Yardbird: a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)[23]</li>
            </ul>
            Chicken was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources,
            chicken as a
            species were typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.[24][page needed][failed verification]
            Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[25
        </section>
        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e. a roostin bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th century
        as
        a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English <a
            href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cock">cock</a> ,[26][27][28] and is widely used
        throughout
        North America. Roosting is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night.[29]

        <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
        <h3>Behavior</h3>
        <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
        <p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of
            eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a 'pecking
            order',
            with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters
            from
            a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding
            hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[36]</p>

        <h2>A Chicken Poem</h2>
        <p>There was once a pretty chicken;<br>
            But his friends were very few,<br>
            For he thought that there was nothing<br>
            In the world but what he knew:<br>
            So he always, in the farmyard,<br>
            Had a very forward way,<br>
            Telling all the hens and turkeys<br>
            What they ought to do and say.<br>
            "Mrs. Goose," he said, "I wonder<br>
            That your goslings you should let<br>
            Go out paddling in the water;<br>
            It will kill them to get wet."</p>
